# Regression and Correlation

1. A *correlation* test tells if a continuous variable is associated with another continuous variable.
Pearson's r (Cohen, 1998) can indicate the strength and the direction (positive or negative) of this association (or no association). 

The correlation is weak if r is between -.10 to -.30 (negative) or .10 to .30 (positive), moderate if r is between  -.30 to -.50 or .30 to .50, or strong if r is between -.50 to -1.00 or .50 to 1.00.



2. *Linear regression* analysis can help us understand if a continuous variable can predict another continuous variable.
The results of the regression cannot indicate any casual relationships between these variables. Another kind of regression is the non-linear regression.
